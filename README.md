This documentation provides a detailed overview of liquid staking smart contract that manages a multi-step financial lifecycle involving rewards, staking, liquidity distribution, and redemption. It explains how the contract stores and manages data, describes the core functions (instantiation, execution, querying), and outlines periodic tasks triggered by time intervals. The document also shows how off-chain Bash scripts interact with the contract by querying state, performing external operations like IBC transfers and staking, and then updating the on-chain data structures accordingly.


# Minimum 35 percent steady revenue growth in each run cycle

This document outlines a strategic approach to liquid staking and redemption cycles, emphasizing how staking at different redemption rate (RR) phases affects overall revenue and token conversion efficiency. It uses numerical examples and calculations to show how redeeming at higher RRs (like 1.4 or above) can significantly increase returns. The text compares two strategies—one that involves heavy early staking at lower RRs and another that spreads staking out at higher RRs—illustrating how timing and redemption rates influence the amount of stARCH obtained and the resulting revenue growth. Additionally, it mentions various data visualizations (medians of rewards, deposit records, and liquidity metrics over time and blockheight) and discusses pipeline tracking of funds, providing a framework for monitoring and optimizing the entire staking-to-redemption lifecycle. Redemption Rate Arbitrage (RRA)- By purchasing LSTs at a discount and redeeming them at a higher rate, Dapps can secure massive profits.
If liquid restaking graph can be generated across stride, quicksilver, persistence one, parallel redemption rate arbitrage can make massive profits 2x and more (leading to 80 percent revenue growth in short period/run cycle)

This document describes how to configure multiple host zones—like Dymension, Celestia, and Archway—in a Stride-like interchain staking environment. It details the necessary constants, account addresses (for delegations, rewards, deposits, redemptions, and claims), and default genesis states that define how each host zone integrates with the system. It also explains the validation checks, recommended settings for redemption rates, unbonding periods, and the importance of correct IBC channel IDs and addresses. Overall, it provides a blueprint for securely and consistently adding new host zones to an interchain staking setup.

This document outlines a multi-chain expansion plan for integrating various blockchains—like Stargaze, Sei, Neutron, Celestia, Osmosis, Regen, Umee, Juno, and Sommelier—into a flexible, contract-based reward model. It shows how each chain’s unique economic activities (e.g., NFT fees on Stargaze, trading fees on Sei, data availability services on Celestia) can feed into a common contract structure via periodic reward updates. The contract’s cron jobs and metadata configuration allow these chain-specific rewards to be converted into stakes, liquidity tokens, and redemption tokens, giving users a continuous stream of yield tied to diverse value sources across multiple ecosystems.

This document outlines a blockchain-based smart contract model for managing digital advertisements while preventing fraud, all on the Archway network. It explains how the contract tracks ad impressions and stores immutable, tamper-proof records of ad views, ensuring transparent and trustworthy ad performance metrics. By integrating reward mechanisms, such as automatically distributing tokens to participants, and using batch operations for scalability, the system can handle large daily transaction volumes. The resulting continuous stream of ad-related transactions generates ongoing staking rewards through Archway’s incentives. This creates a positive feedback loop: the more active the ad ecosystem, the more the contract and its participants benefit from Archway’s reward pool, ultimately driving daily usage and encouraging long-term growth.

This document outlines a “Redemption Rate Advisor” system designed to help users make informed staking and redemption decisions in a tokenized ecosystem. It details how the system continuously tracks on-chain data to calculate the current Redemption Rate (RR) and related metrics, uses modeling and forecasting to predict RR changes after hypothetical staking or redemption actions, and provides phase-based guidance (Accumulation, Caution, Redemption) for optimal decision-making. The system includes customizable alerts, scenario simulations, and a user-friendly interface, enabling users to visualize potential outcomes, set thresholds, receive timely notifications, and ultimately optimize their strategies based on real-time and projected RR trends.

This document describes data ingestion pipeline that captures smart contract event data from an Archway blockchain node, stores it in Elasticsearch, and provides a “query bible” for analyzing that data. It explains how to:

1. Subscribe to and retrieve events via a WebSocket connection.
2. Log events to a file and parse them with an ingestion service.
3. Structure the event data into a well-defined Elasticsearch index with a clear mapping of fields.
4. Run various queries and aggregations to gain insights into staking operations, liquidity changes, reward distributions, and more.
5. Utilize Kibana dashboards and alerts for visualization and monitoring, and leverage advanced Elasticsearch features (like machine learning and Vega visualizations) for enhanced analytics and anomaly detection.

Overall, it offers a comprehensive blueprint for transforming raw on-chain event data into actionable intelligence using Elasticsearch’s full-text search and analytics capabilities.
